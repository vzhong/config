# Linux Setup

This repository consists of a series of setup binaries and dotfiles. It is mostly used for personal setup of Linux machines for machine learning development. The main entrypoint into the setup is `install`:

```sh
./install
```

Optionally, one can configure additional tools as described below. The optional tools installation requires more handholding, as the libaries may not be stable.

## Machine learning

```sh
./ml
```
